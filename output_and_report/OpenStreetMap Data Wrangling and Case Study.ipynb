Values of None were emitted for these streets, and so were effectively removed from the data.  At this point there was a collection of streets that could not be corrected programmatically, and so were updated using a dictionary mapping.

Regular expressions and a mapping were used to replace abbreviated directions for North, South, East, and West with their longer counterpart.  If a floor, suite, zip code, or housenumber was present these were removed from the street and were assigned to the 'addr:floor', 'addr:suite', 'addr:postcode', or 'addr:housenumber' tag key, respectively.  Regular expressions were used to find numbered streets that didn't use numbers to represent them (e.g. Fourth as opposed to 4th).  These were then replaced using a mapping to their numbered equivalent.  Finally, the street type (e.g. Street, Road, Place) was extracted using regular expressions, and it was replaced using a mapping if it was an abbreviation.\n",
